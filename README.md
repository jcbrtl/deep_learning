## Repository Structure
This repository is built using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). The library folder is `.ignore`, as nothing important will be done here. Also, the notebooks folder is `deep_learning/nbs`.

1. `deep_learning` folder
    1. **nbs** - This folder can be ignored as it contains the notebooks needed to build the docs. Every file in `nbs` folder has the following structure.
        
        `deep_learning/nbs/notes_dl1_2020_lesson1.ipynb` -> file in `nbs` folder
        
        `deep_learning/notes/dl1_2020/lesson1.md` -> original file in `notes/dl1_2020` folder
        
        Based on the above syntax every notebook has a filename that corresponds to some folder in the original `deep_learning` folder.

    2. **notes** - Check the [README.md](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/blob/master/deep_learning/notes/README.md) of this folder for more details. It contains detailed lesson notes of fastai courses (dl1 2020) + personal scanned notes.
