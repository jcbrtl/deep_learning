## Repository Structure
This repository is built using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). The library folder is `dl` nothing important will be done here. Also, the notebooks folder is `deep_learning/nbs`.

1. `dl` folder - **Ignore this folder**. This is autogenerated folder by nbdev for the library code.

1. [deep_learning](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/deep_learning) folder
    1. [nbs](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/deep_learning/nbs) - **Ignore this folder** as it contains the notebooks needed to build the docs. Every file in `nbs` folder has the following structure.
        
        `deep_learning/nbs/notes_dl1_2020_lesson1.ipynb` -> file in `nbs` folder
        
        `deep_learning/notes/dl1_2020/lesson1.md` -> original file in `notes/dl1_2020` folder
        
        Based on the above syntax every notebook has a filename that corresponds to some folder in the original `deep_learning` folder.

    2. [notes](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/deep_learning/notes) - Check the [README.md](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/blob/master/deep_learning/notes/README.md) of this folder for more details. It contains detailed lesson notes of fastai courses (dl1 2020) + personal scanned notes.
        1. Courses covered
            - Deep Learning for Coders 2020
        2. Personal notes
    
    3. [projects](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/deep_learning/projects) - Paper implementations are not included in this folder.
        - Semi-supervised parking lot detection -> my submission for Techgig Code Gladiators 2019 AI theme final.
        - Waste Seggregation using trashnet -> Contains the code to train models for trashnet and then export them using ONNX. It was part of a bigger project where we ran these models on Rasberry Pi, which controlled wooden planks to classify the waste into different categories (code for rasberry pi not included here).
    
    4. [random](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/deep_learning/random) - Random scripts and os setup instructions.
        - os_setup_iinstructions -> guide to setup Windows10 pro and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on my laptop according to my preferences
        - cifar10_data_script.py -> to convert CIFAR10 to numpy array
        - save_torchvision_models_to_disk -> a quick script to download all pytorch models
        
2. [c++](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/c%2B%2B) folder - Check the [README.md](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/c%2B%2B/README.md) of this folder for more details. It is practice of data structures and algorithms using c++ in my free time.
