These are called protocols because usually what you are doing is taking some fixed mechanism by which you answer a question or perform some operation, you are hooking into it to add some small amendment or some small modification and then you are dispatching back to that same protocol on either constituent object or on base class. Now one of the rules for the `__repr__` method is that you should be able to cut and paste the result into a terminal and you should be able to get a new object.
