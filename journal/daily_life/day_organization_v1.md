### Agenda for work
1. Complete 1 lesson of a course. (permanent for now but if done over the next few months, this can become temporary)

    There are many courses I want to complete and new courses are being released/found from time to time. Completing 1 lesson of a course including all the extra materials associated with that lesson is necessary to complete these.

2. Social Media / Random small work (permanent)
    * Gmail 
    * Twitter 
    * pytorch forums 
    * fastai forums
    * paperswithcode
    * arxiv sanity
    * Write screenshots
    * Youtube subscriptions
  
    plus, some extra work that comes day to day that you have to do without excuses.

3. Read extra books (permanent for now but if done for next 2 months, this can be completed and then rarely have to do this)

    A lot of books to read for now, and time period of only 2 months, so read 2 chapters of 2 books each day, to quickly complete it.

4. Learn libraries (can be removed, but need to complete some libraries so 2 weeks would be enough to complete it, in the long term I can spend a day or two to complete a library that I want)

    Libraries to cover
    * pandas
    * vaex
    * pytorch
    * fastai
    * pytorch lighting
    * dask
    * latex

5. Learn data structure and algorithms (temporary, few books to cover)

6. Important work for future
   1. Blog about papers I read
   2. Read conference papers
   3. Read latest papers
   4. Kaggle competitions
   5. Work on combining/improving ideas in papers

### Summary of Work
1. Courses (temporary)(2 month period). To achieve this I would need to complete 2 lessons everyday, assuming the lectures are 2 hours long. With this I would be able to do around 5 courses this month.
2. Extra Books (temporary)(1.5 month period). Read 2 books with 2 chapters each.
3. Learn libraries (temporary)(can be done in 2 weeks). Prioritize pytorch->vaex->pandas->pytorch lighting->fastai->dask->latex
4. Data Structures and Algos (temporary)(can be done in 1 month). Complete 1 chapter of book everyday with implementations also.
5. Social Media (permanent)(takes less than 30 minutes). Most of the time here is taken on pytorch forums, youtube subscriptions.
6. Important work for future
   1. Blogging (do it on alternate days or after reading papers)
   2. Conference papers (skip for now, will be able to go through 1,2,3,4)
   3. Latest papers (Do this daily)
   4. Kaggle competitions (skip for now, will be able to go through 1,2,3,4)

### Priorities
**2** can be easily done in 2 weeks if I am motivated. So 1.5 hour each day.

**3** can be done slowly along with 2. So 40 minutes each day.

**4** can be also be done quickly as I know most of the stuff, so can be adjusted for above time frame.

**1** It will take time. Also, this can be done as time moves along. Keep it light for the first two weeks, where priority is to complete [2,3,4] and then can allot the time from these to [1].

**6** Time left.
