Did not achieve much.

Completed all the small work that was preventing me from focusing on the main task
- organize study table
- make list of conference
- make a proper schedule to get work done (started this note taking also)

After today, I do not have any excuse preventing me from doing work. Everything is organized and taken care of. A new daily plan would be followed from tomorrow.

I will try a new strategy for making schedule tomorrow. Make schedule when I wake up and make it in 3 chunks (wake to lunch, lunch to exercise, exercise to sleep). Making schedule the previous day has some problems
- If I wake up late, the entire schedule is a waste
- Cannot adjust for tasks that were out of my control
- It did not take into account the fatigue from exercise from previous day

Let's see if this note-taking thing plays out. I have never tried to maintain a journal of myself before. 

Made [daily_organization_v1.md](day_organization_v1.md). The time limit I have set for myself is 2 weeks for this organization.
